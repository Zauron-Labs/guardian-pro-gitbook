# Configuration Options

This page provides a comprehensive configuration worksheet for customizing your Guardian Pro deployment. Complete this worksheet and share it with your Zauron representative to ensure your system is configured to match your organization's peer review policies and workflows.

Peer learning policy questions (what counts as activity, AI triage, author notification, conferences) are on the [Peer Learning Decisions](peer-learning-decisions.md) worksheet.

These values are picker and employer policies. They are applied at install and can later be adjusted in the Guardian dashboard **Admin** tab. Infrastructure settings (PACS AE titles, reporting endpoints, registry, TLS) are collected on the [Installation Guide](installation.md) checklist, not here.

## Parameter Explanations

### Case Volume Settings

**Minimum number of cases seen by rads per week**
Sets the floor for radiologist participation. No regulatory required minimum but organizations typically set by number or percent.  

**Maximum number of cases seen by rads per week**
Caps the peer review workload to prevent reviewer fatigue and maintain quality assessments even if AI flags abnormalities.  

**Number of interesting cases seen by rads per week**
Guardian Pro's AI engine identifies cases with unusual findings, teaching value, or potential discrepancies. This setting controls how many of these flagged cases are routed to each radiologist weekly.

### Quality Assurance Settings

**RadPeer threshold for notifying the quality champion**
Uses the standard RadPeer scoring scale (1-4). A score of 2b or higher indicates a discrepancy that is likely clinically significant. When this threshold is met, the designated Quality Champion receives automatic notification for review and follow-up.

**Number of cases (in last 3 months) to be qualified to peer review a case**
Ensures peer reviewers have recent, relevant experience. Radiologists must have interpreted at least this many cases in the past 90 days to be eligible as peer reviewers, maintaining expertise currency.

**Minimum number of random exams per week**
Guarantees baseline quality sampling independent of AI flagging. These randomly selected cases provide unbiased quality metrics and satisfy accreditation requirements for random peer review.

### Personnel Settings

**Quality Champion**
Identify the individual(s) responsible for quality oversight. This person receives escalation notifications, manages discrepancy follow-up, and oversees peer review program compliance.

**Residents and Fellows Receive Emails**
Determines whether trainees receive notifications of interesting cases. Enable this to include trainees in the educational feedback loop; disable if your program handles trainee feedback through separate channels.  

**Residents and Fellows Participate in Random QC**
Controls trainee inclusion in random quality sampling. Consider your accreditation requirements and educational objectives when configuring this setting. Trainees are required by Graduate Medical Education mandates to do a Quality Improvement project, this can satisfy the requirement for all of your trainees. 

### AI Configuration

**Target Positive Predictive Value for Discrepancy Inclusion**
Sets the AI confidence threshold for flagging cases. A value of 0.5 means the a peer reviewer will typically see 1 false positive and 1 true positive during the AI peer review process. Higher values reduce false positives but may miss some true discrepancies; lower values increase sensitivity but require more manual review.

**AI Model Inclusion Policy**
Defines governance for integrating new AI models into your Guardian Pro instance. Default to rely on Zauron's AI Governance methods to ensure model validation.

**AI Model Update Policy**
Establishes the process for updating existing AI models. Default is to rely on Zauron's AI Governance methods to ensure updates are tested and validated before deployment.

## How to Complete This Worksheet
